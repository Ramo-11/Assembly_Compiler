*************************************Assembly compiler**************************************

My final project is called Assembly compiler, and the program does the following tasks:

1- Have a log in system.

2- Allow the user to write code in Assembly and solve problems.
    a- checks if there is syntax error in the opcode.
    b- checks if there is syntax error in the operand.

3- Give users the options to view previous solution:
    a- The user can't view a solution to a problem that they haven't attempted to solve yet.
    b- The program disregard the syntax error that the user made when writing code, and only shows the correct commands.

4- When the user is satisfied with their answers, they can submit their solution to a specific problem:
    a- if the answer is correct, the user's profile gets updated.
    b- if it is wrong, the user can view their progress and reattempt solving the problem.

5- The user can also view a list of available commands the program currently have.

Addition information:
    There are 18 commands, and each have a specific task.
    There are currently 5 levels that the program has.
    The user can't view an answer to a problem they haven't attempted and can't submit it either.
    
The program has 2 can handle two types or errors:
    Syntax errors and logical errors.

There is a lot of room for improvement, such as addding more commands or adding more levels.
